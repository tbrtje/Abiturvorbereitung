- On average they are still paid less, but the difference has been steadily declining and can be explained by women making different
  career choices
  - this becomes visible when looking at workplace fatalitys: Women only account for less then 10 percent.
- In some careers women earn more for the same work (IT and Computer Science)

### Chances and Risks

| ---------- |  --------------- |  ------ |
| AI        | can automate things, that werent possible before, ie. Image  recognition, recognition of sicknesses, tumors and the like |the singularity scares people, they fear an almighty, general AI that is smarter than we are, which is impossible in the near future |
| Gene Manipulation | Has the potential to eliminate genetic diseases and things like cancer | a service that produces desirable children could be dangerous |
| Broadband Internet | Helps to diminuish the differences between poor and rich nations in terms of possibillities and chances, could lead to a fairer world | Could lead to a higher personal investment into netbased activities |
| NeuroLinks | Could expand the longterm memory and knowledge, could help to make alzheimers a thing of the past | Increases the reliance on technology, could be desasterous if exploited |




 
### Visions of the Future
### The Media and its Influence on Public Opinion and Personal Life
The medias influence can be seen quite clearly when looking at the difference between Trumps and Bidens presidency.
When there are migrant children being held in temporary facilitys, waiting to be deported under president Trump, there was a general
outrage, when there are literally 10 times as many under president Biden, it isnt an issue worth reporting about.

When Trump walked down a slippery ramp without a handrail slowly and cautiously, his health was questioned and he was called incapable,
when Biden falls down the stairs to AirForce One repeatedly for no reason, its absolutely normal.

Even the German Tagesschau is guilty of this biased reporting. Their coverage of Trump was universally negative, leaving out everything
good he did,with them even adding fake booing sounds to his speeches.
The best thing about this: The general population doesnt care about it. They believe everything thats televised and broadcasted without
checking it. And they repeat it like parrots.

### The Digital Revolution

The usage of smartphones has increased dramatically. It changed the way we communicate, meet and get to know each other. It connected
the world and made it so much smaller.
The internet made knowledge accessible for everyone at anytime. Access to news has never been easier.
Free speech has never been this free. Everyone can create his own blog and make his voice heard.

But it isnt all fine and dandy, the internet also has a few big problems.
Interactions and relationships get less and less personal. The Apps that promised to connect us, made us addicted.
We feel overwhelmed by the way others portray themselves on social media, we feel like we are not equal to them.
We are more depressed than our parents and grandparents. We became addicted to the dopamine released when a new message pops up, when
we refresh our We devalue human touch and sexual interactions by broadcasting ourselves on
OnlyFans for a few dollars and the whole world to see.
We get dependent on the accessability of Wikipedia and the like, so our memories become worse.
Our attention span is decreasing, some studies claim it lasts less than four seconds now.
## Globalisation
### Effects on the World of Work
Globalisation killed off a lot of local industries, but helped to lift other countries to a higher standard of living. China is such an example, rising from the worlds factory to the worlds creator in just a few years.
### Impact on Personal Lives
The globalized world has lead to an increase of stress, but connected people from all over the world, making friendships across countries possible and easier.
The prosperity caused by globalisation and the decreasing prices of products caused a higher standard of living.
